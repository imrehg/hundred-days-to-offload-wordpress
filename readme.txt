## Description

A basic helper to see whether you have achieved [`#100DaysToOffload`](https://100daystooffload.com/),
that is publishing 100 posts on your website. To see your progress after installing the plugin,
navigate to **Posts > Hundred Days to Offload** in your WordPress dashboard.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change the target number of posts?

Not at this point, and probably not in the future either, to keep with the spirit
of `#100DaysToOffload`.

### Can I change the time interval over which the posts are counted?

Also not at this point, and probably not in the future either, to keep with the spirit
of `#100DaysToOffload`.

### Can I see whether I achieved 100DaysToOffload in the past?

Not at this point, but looking at adding that feature in the future.

### I have multiple users on my blog, can they have their separate progress?

Not at this point, though possible in the future. The spirit of `#100DaysToOffload`
is using your personal blog, though, where it's unlikely to have multiple users.

### Should the metric be "100 posts in a year" or "100 unique days when something was posted"?

Yeah, the name and the spirit of the project might be open for multiple interpretations,
but the [100DaysToOffload website](https://100daystooffload.com/#guidelines) is pretty
clear on the former interpretation. In the future there might be more options to switch
the plugin between these two or give you information according to either of them.
